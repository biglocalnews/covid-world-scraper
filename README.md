Questions for our Meeting:

What is the ideal format for the?
What is the plan for rolling the map out?
- ie, Will we wait until we gather all of the data to publish it?
What are the expectations in terms of scrapers?
What is the minimum necessary to publish the map? (Hopefully we will far exceed an MVP - but we still need to define one)
What are the questions PITCH has for us?
